*"Won't you be my neighbor?" is substituted for all item containing '3', regardless of any other numbers in that item;
*"Boop!" is substituted for all entries containing '2', unless the entry also includes '3';
*"Beep!" is substituted for all entries containing '1', unless the number also includes a '2' or '3'.
